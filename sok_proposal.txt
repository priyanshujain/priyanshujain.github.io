Background: 
I am a undergraduate Computer Science student studying in Guru Ghasidas
University, located in Bilaspur, India. I have been using C, C++, Python & Bash
for around 2-3 years now and hence, quite proficient in them. Apart from
academics, I have great interest in Free & Open Source Software. I am a member

Hardware: I use a Lenovo G460 laptop. Its an intel core i3 powered laptop with
8 GB RAM. It is equipped with a webcam and 120 gb ssd. I prefer to do my work
from home using laptop with external large screen monitor but I also have access
 to computer lab of my university. I also own a RaspberryPi2 Model B+ and a
 Tegra Note 7(android tablet).

Operating System: I use Arch Linux as my primary operating system in my laptop.
I also have Raspbian running on the Pi.
Internet Connection: I have a unfiltered and proxyless 5 Mb/sec Wireless
broadband connection at home. There are several unrestricted hotspots in my
locality and University. If required I can use a 3G mobile data connection
using usb modem.

Development tools: I use Atom as my code editor along with GCC5 v5.3.0.I use
GDB for debugging.Lint in Atom,valgrind for checking memory errors.

Project title : Improve stability and feature set of Kexi MS Access import

Mentor:Jaros≈Çaw Staniek <staniek@kde.org>

What makes you the best person to work on this project?

I like contributing to open source and have prior experience.
I have the required skills and I am a fast learner.
I have good communication skills and can clearly and concisely communicate
development related issues.

The idea of improving database access software, will help me become familiar
with the functioning of real world applications. I want to work on making
software easily accessible and understandable to the end user. Working on the
Kexi project will give me an excellent opportunity to do so and at the same
time enhance my skill and knowledge which in turn will help me get things done
in future.


Project Details:
Kexi is a visual database applications creator, part of the Calligra Suite.
Kexi Support for importing Microsoft Access databases (2003 or older) is built
into Kexi. It uses the import wizard by selecting desired .mdb file. MDB
databases are files produced by the Microsoft 'Jet' database engine. They are
used as the format for Microsoft Access databases. MDB Tools is an open source
suite of libraries and utilities to read (and soon write) MDB database files.
Current mdbtools sources included with Kexi (kexi.git) for MS Access mdb format
 support can be outdated. Trying to get people to move to Kexi from Access at
 some point, means the should be able to move their existing data/design also.


Benefits to kexi:
Improved mdb support will attract more people for moving from access to kexi.


Expected results:

Use the newest mdbtools code from https://github.com/brianb/mdbtools and merge
patches made by the Kexi project (once filled at
https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=277583, the task may be need a repeat).

Propose and implement improvements to the MDB support.
If this means extensive testing with mdb data files and reverse-engineering,
plan this as well.

Provide the patches upstream for the mdbtools project, which would improve
packaging.

Update instructions for the packagers.


Project schedule:


November
Week 1,2: Will get in touch with the mentor and will aim at building source code.
Understanding current existing source code.
Familiarization with the mdbtools.
Week 3,4:
Would be busy with university examinations. Still would try to work as much as
possible.


December
Week 1,2,3:
Testing with mdb files on existing mdbtools.
Use the newest mdbtools code and merge patches made by the Kexi project.
Week 4:
This week would be off from college.
Will continue working on mdbtools.
Test with mdb files on newly implemented mdbtools.


January
Keep working on testing and Solve bugs.
Implement improvements to the MDB support.
Extensive testing with mdb data files and reverse-engineering.
February
Get reviewed by the mentor and other people on reviewboard.
Improve packaging.
Provide the patches upstream.
Complete the project.


Other winter Plans:
I have no other plans for this season and will easily be able to devote
20-25 hrs/week to the project.

My previous experience with Kde:
I applied for gsoc 2016[2] in kde but unfortunately did not got selected.
I am familiar with kde build system and kde applications development.
I have just begun my journey. But, I plan on going a long way.


After SoK:
I will continue to contributing to kexi and kde.
