    <br>“first thing it is simple but not easy”

First step is that your resume is selected for interview, and acceptance/hiring rate of google is 0.2%. they give time on your resume max 10 to 20 seconds.

so word should be deliberately answer this question why should we hire you.

so you have to be involved in some projects in your desired field and you can go for some open source contribution. like if you want to work on amazon.com front page design and make your beautiful webpage it can be your online portfolio.

or if you want to work for microsoft’s xbox make a video game for xbox if want to work on google’s android oS contribute something it’s open source right or if you want to work on facebook mobile app make your own android or ios app. do what you do from that put it on github and make these link to your resume or linkedin profile. Now you have some experience and stuff to put on your resume. And these side projects show that your passion about what you do. and you can also participate in as many as hackathon in this you learn a lot and meet a lot of like minded or great people. and as i said quality of work you do or what you do is really vert important because you shold be haapy with what you are doing. another way to get into interviews are programming challenges like on interview street they have question like implement LRU cache or circular buffer, even if you don’t get call for interview from this it’s okay you can put this on resume. you can practice a lot for programming on hackerrank, codeforces , SPOJ, top coder. participate in their challenges and competitions, you can put also on your resume like solved over 500 problems on hackerrank. Participate in prestigious competitions like codejam or ACM ICPC they have an great impact on your resume or your work. for preparing for these follow link For an ACM beginner, how should I start? .One another way to get an interview call is referral you can gently ask your friend or relative that is working in these companies ad go for interview.

Second step is perform good in your interview. so these are coding interviews obviously. you have done a lot coding practice in first step of our work. so time to speed up. prepare writing code on paper or white board or google docs. increase your speed and productivity. because you have very less time to write code for problem that is asked in interviews. generally these companies conduct 1–2 45 minutes interview on phone screen and 3–4 45 minute onsite at their campus.

here i am telling you two bibles for interview coding questions:

1 cracking the coding interview (CTCI): It has questions and their solutions that interviewers already have asked multiple times in past with other candidates. most of the problems are from concepts of data structures and algorithms.

2 Programming interview exposed(PIE): PIE is for very newbies and likely same as CTCI.

and one thing is in interview no one asks for brain teasers and they don’t care your solution is right or wrong they realize your problem solving approach and problem solving ability. Learn object oriented programming and design some times they ask question from this. design question will be in interview but more focus on coding array, tree, recursion, sorting, graph algorithms. for networking and database your own discretion. no behavioral question will be asked. after that For example you should know that you know how to code all permutations of string using recursive solution or two strings are anagrams of each other or finding intersection of two list or finding duplicates in an array they all follow the same pattern ,you do brute force and that is O(1) running time with O(1) memory, you can do that all O(nlogn) , O(n) O(logn) depending upon which sorting algorithm you use. you can use the hash table that is O(n) memory and O(n) running time. best is hash table or sorting approach. and final tip conduct and participate in mock interview. make group of 2 or 3 max. while interview ask question to remove ambiguity and discuss high level approach and annunciate through process as you code. and again practice to write code on paper or white board or keyboard coding.

final words of me
<br><br>
success is like pregnant woman, everyone congratulate you but none of them ask you how many time you got screwed to get there.
