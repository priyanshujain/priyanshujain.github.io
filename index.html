This algorithm is basically a sequence of proposals from men to women, and finds

a stable matching with an extreme property that every man gets his best possible

partner among all stable matchings. and another ongoing project is cool compiler

this is a compiler based on MIPS instruction set and cool is new basic syntax

created for this compiler project.<br><br><br><br><br>
